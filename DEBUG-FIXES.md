# Debug Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Missing AuthProvider Component
- **Problem**: `app/layout.tsx` imports `AuthProvider` from `@/components/providers/auth-provider` but the file didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created `/components/providers/auth-provider.tsx` with a simple implementation
- **Impact**: This was causing the entire app to fail to render

### 2. Missing framer-motion Dependency
- **Problem**: `PageTransitionProvider` imports `framer-motion` but it's not in package.json
- **Fix**: Simplified the provider to remove framer-motion dependency
- **Impact**: Prevents runtime errors during component rendering

## Debug Files Created:

1. `/public/debug-index.html` - Static HTML test page
2. `/app/page.debug.tsx` - Minimal React component test
3. `/app/layout.debug.tsx` - Simplified layout for testing
4. `/app/page.test.tsx` - Working test page
5. `/app/globals.css` - Force visibility CSS (temporary)

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Test static serving**: Visit `/debug-index.html` to verify hosting works
2. **Test React rendering**: Visit `/page.test` to verify Next.js works
3. **Test original page**: Visit `/` to see if the main page now renders

## Next Steps:

1. If the main page now renders, remove all debug files
2. If still blank, check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Gradually re-enable complex features (animations, etc.) one by one

## Files to Remove After Fix:

- `/public/debug-index.html`
- `/app/page.debug.tsx`
- `/app/layout.debug.tsx`
- `/app/page.test.tsx`
- `/app/globals.css` (restore original)

## Production Deployment:

The fixes should work in production. The main issues were:
1. Missing component causing import errors
2. Missing dependency causing runtime errors

Both are now resolved with minimal, working implementations.
