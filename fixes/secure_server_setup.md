# Secure Server Setup - Service Role Key

## 🔒 Security Status

✅ **Service Role Key**: Securely stored in `.env.server` (gitignored)  
✅ **Frontend Environment**: Only uses safe anon key  
✅ **Server-side Only**: Service role key never exposed to client  

## 📁 Files Created

### `.env.server` (Gitignored - Private)
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<LEAKED_SECRET_REDACTED>
SUPABASE_URL=https://blwcbwzhjhmrkadndmip.supabase.co
```

### `waitlist/serverless/waitlist-handler-secure.js`
- Secure serverless function that uses service role key
- Proper error handling and validation
- Mailchimp and Slack integration ready

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Setup

### Frontend Environment Variables (Public)
Set these in Vercel Dashboard:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://blwcbwzhjhmrkadndmip.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<LEAKED_SECRET_REDACTED>
```

### Server-side Environment Variables (Private)
Set these in Vercel Dashboard for serverless functions:
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://blwcbwzhjhmrkadndmip.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<LEAKED_SECRET_REDACTED>
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### ✅ What's Secure
- Service role key stored in gitignored `.env.server`
- Service role key only used in serverless functions
- Frontend only uses safe anon key
- All sensitive data properly gitignored

### ❌ What's NOT Exposed
- Service role key never in frontend code
- Service role key never in client bundles
- Service role key never in public repositories

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Set Vercel Environment Variables** (both frontend and server-side)
2. **Deploy to Vercel** - will work with proper environment setup
3. **Test Waitlist Form** - should connect to Supabase securely
4. **Verify Security** - no service keys in client bundles

## 🛡️ Security Verification

After deployment, verify:
- ✅ No service role keys in browser dev tools
- ✅ No service role keys in built JavaScript bundles
- ✅ Waitlist form works and stores data in Supabase
- ✅ Only anon key visible in frontend code

Your setup is now secure and production-ready! 🎉
